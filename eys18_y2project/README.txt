This folder contains the modules and scripts needed to run the ‘Thermodynamics Snookered’ simulation for the Y2 computing project. 

‘ball.py’ is a module that contains the ball and container class.
‘simulation.py’ is a module that contains the simulation class which imports ‘ball.py’.
‘test.py’ imports both ‘simulation.py’ and ‘ball.py’  and contains the scripts used to run the simulation as well as the testing to obtain the graphs and data used in the report.

Simply running each module beforehand should allow the simulation to run smoothly. Note that the simulation works best only when initialising with a square number of balls (i.e. 4, 25, 36…).
